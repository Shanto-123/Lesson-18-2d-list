# Lesson-18-2d-list
The code modifies the second item in the grocery list, replacing 'potatoes' with 'oill', and then prints the entire updated list, the last item ('milk'), the third item ('rice'), and a slice of the list containing the second item ('oill'). The second part of the code initializes a `max` variable with the first price and iterates over the `price` list to find and print the maximum value (15). The `for` loop compares each value with `max`, updating it if the current value is greater. The largest value in the list is stored in `max` and printed.
